# Exercise 1: Database Migration with DMS and Aurora

## Objective
Implement a complete database migration strategy using AWS DMS with Aurora as the target.

## Scenario
Migrate a MySQL database from on-premises to AWS Aurora MySQL with minimal downtime using Database Migration Service.

## Tasks

### 1. Migration Environment Setup
```bash
# Deploy the migration domain
terraform apply -var-file="study-configs/sa-pro-migration.tfvars"
```

### 2. DMS Configuration
- Set up DMS replication instance
- Configure source and target endpoints
- Create replication tasks

### 3. Aurora Target Preparation
- Deploy Aurora MySQL cluster
- Configure security groups and subnet groups
- Set up monitoring and backups

### 4. Migration Execution
- Start full load migration
- Monitor replication progress
- Implement CDC (Change Data Capture)

### 5. Cutover Strategy
- Plan application cutover
- Implement rollback procedures
- Validate data integrity

## Key Concepts
- DMS replication types (full-load, CDC, full-load-and-cdc)
- Aurora performance optimization
- Migration monitoring and troubleshooting
- Data validation techniques

## Validation Steps
1. Compare source and target row counts
2. Validate data consistency
3. Test application connectivity
4. Verify performance metrics

## Best Practices
- Pre-migration assessment
- Network optimization
- Security configurations
- Monitoring and alerting
