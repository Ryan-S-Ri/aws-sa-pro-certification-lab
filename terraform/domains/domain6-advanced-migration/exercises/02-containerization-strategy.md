# Exercise 2: Application Containerization and Migration

## Objective
Migrate a traditional application to containers using Amazon ECS with Fargate.

## Scenario
Transform a monolithic application into containerized microservices and deploy using ECS with modern DevOps practices.

## Tasks

### 1. Container Strategy
- Analyze application architecture
- Design containerization approach
- Create container images

### 2. ECS Deployment
- Set up ECS cluster
- Configure task definitions
- Deploy services with Fargate

### 3. Service Discovery and Load Balancing
- Implement service discovery
- Configure Application Load Balancer
- Set up health checks

### 4. Monitoring and Logging
- Configure CloudWatch Container Insights
- Set up centralized logging
- Implement performance monitoring

### 5. Auto Scaling Configuration
- Configure service auto scaling
- Set up target tracking policies
- Test scaling behavior

## Migration Patterns
- Strangler Fig pattern
- Database per service
- Event-driven architecture
- Circuit breaker pattern

## Validation
1. Test application functionality
2. Verify auto scaling works
3. Check monitoring dashboards
4. Validate security configurations

## Advanced Topics
- Blue/green deployments
- Canary releases
- Multi-region deployments
- Cost optimization strategies
